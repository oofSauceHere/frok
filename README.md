# frok

Frok is an "AI chatbot" that just routes any inquiries to a discord bot for a real person to respond to. Client-side made with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS. The server and bot are written in python (using `websockets` and `discord.py` respectively), running multithreaded from [frok.py](server/frok.py).
